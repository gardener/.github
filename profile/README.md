# :seedling: Welcome to the Gardener Project on GitHub

![Gardener Logo](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/logo/gardener.svg)

:wave: Welcome to the official GitHub organization of the Gardener Project. We are an open-source project that brings homogeneous Kubernetes-clusters-as-a-Service to multi-cloud environments.
Our mission is to provide robust, scalable, and efficient Kubernetes clusters using hosted control planes.

## :globe_with_meridians: What is Gardener?

Gardener is a Kubernetes extension that implements automated system management.
It provides a lean, extensible, and multi-cloud capable API server that integrates existing cloud providers and open-source cloud computing libraries.
Gardener is designed to support scalability and resilience for large-scale systems, and it's capable of managing thousands of Kubernetes clusters across multiple cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, OpenStack, AliCloud, and more).

## :handshake: Gardener and ApeiroRA

Gardener is proud to be part of the [ApeiroRA project](https://apeirora.eu/), an EU initiative that aims to develop a reference blueprint for an open, flexible, powerful, secure, and compliant next-generation cloud-edge continuum.
This blueprint will be made available as an open-source construction kit, providing blueprints and reusable components for central building blocks.
While the specific contribution of Gardener to the ApeiroRA project is not explicitly mentioned, it can be inferred that Gardener is actively involved in the development and implementation of the reference blueprint and the overall goal of strengthening digital sovereignty for Europe.

## :star2: Key Features

- **Multi-Cloud:** Gardener supports a wide range of cloud providers, allowing you to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters across different cloud environments.
- **Automated Operations:** Gardener automates many of the day-to-day tasks involved in managing Kubernetes clusters, such as updates, backups, and scaling.
- **Extensibility:** Gardener is designed to be extensible, allowing you to add support for new infrastructure providers, operating systems, networking plugins, and more.
- **Secure and Compliant:** Gardener ensures that the Kubernetes clusters are secure and compliant with the necessary standards.
- **Conformance:** All Kubernetes clusters managed by Gardener are [conformant as per the CNCF's conformance tests](https://testgrid.kubernetes.io/conformance-gardener).
- **Open-Source:** Gardener is completely open-source. We welcome contributions from the community and believe in the power of collaborative development.
