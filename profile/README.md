# :seedling: Welcome to the Gardener Project on GitHub

![Gardener Logo](https://github.com/gardener/gardener/blob/master/logo/gardener.svg)

:wave: Welcome to the official GitHub organization of the Gardener Project. We are an open-source project that brings homogeneous Kubernetes-clusters-as-a-Service to multi-cloud environments.
Our mission is to provide robust, scalable, and efficient Kubernetes clusters using hosted control planes.

## :globe_with_meridians: What is Gardener?

Gardener is a Kubernetes extension that implements automated system management.
It provides a lean, extensible, and multi-cloud capable API server that integrates existing cloud providers and open-source cloud computing libraries.
Gardener is designed to support scalability and resilience for large-scale systems, and it's capable of managing thousands of Kubernetes clusters across multiple cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, OpenStack, AliCloud, and more).

## :pushpin: Gardener and NeoNephos

Gardener has been donated to the [NeoNephos Foundation](https://neonephos.org/), a Linux Foundation initiative dedicated to advancing open-source projects that align with the strategic objectives of Important Project of Common European Interest - Next Generation Cloud Infrastructures and Services (IPCEI-CIS) under neutral governance. Learn more about NeoNephos and our role within it [here](https://neonephos.org/).

## :handshake: Gardener and ApeiroRA

[ApeiroRA](https://apeirora.eu/) is a reference blueprint for an open, flexible, secure, and compliant next-generation cloud-edge continuum - and therefore a key contribution to IPCEI-CIS. At a high level, the projects of ApeiroRA allow users to provider-agnostically fetch, request and consume services, and for service providers to describe, offer and provision their services.
By being open source, ApeiroRA provides a cross-border spillover effect, solidifying the foundation and future of the project.
Learn more about ApeiroRA by checking out the [official website](https://apeirora.eu/).

## :star2: Key Features

- **Multi-Cloud:** Gardener supports a wide range of cloud providers, allowing you to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters across different cloud environments.
- **Automated Operations:** Gardener automates many of the day-to-day tasks involved in managing Kubernetes clusters, such as updates, backups, and scaling.
- **Extensibility:** Gardener is designed to be extensible, allowing you to add support for new infrastructure providers, operating systems, networking plugins, and more.
- **Secure and Compliant:** Gardener ensures that the Kubernetes clusters are secure and compliant with the necessary standards.
- **Conformance:** All Kubernetes clusters managed by Gardener are [conformant as per the CNCF's conformance tests](https://testgrid.kubernetes.io/conformance-gardener).
- **Open-Source:** Gardener is completely open-source. We welcome contributions from the community and believe in the power of collaborative development.
